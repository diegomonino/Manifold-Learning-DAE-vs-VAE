-----------
Topological evaluation metrics for representation quality.

    - trustworthiness: measures whether neighbors in latent space are
                       also neighbors in data space (no false neighbors)
    - continuity:      measures whether neighbors in data space remain
                       neighbors in latent space (no missing neighbors)

Both metrics range from 0 to 1, where 1 means perfect preservation.
